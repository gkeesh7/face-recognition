# Face Recognition Personal Project
Exploring the opencv and face_recognition libraries to create a prototype of a project

## The Aim is to 
- Dynamically recognize person from the video feed 
- If not recognized then Labelling them and remembering the Identifier for later use

For now the source is forked from this [example](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/facerec_from_webcam_faster.py)

## How to run the demo 
- Install python 3.x
- Install the pre-requisite libraries

```bash
#install opencv for python
pip install opencv-python

#insall face-recognition library
pip install face-recongnition

```

- Run the code using the following command

``` bash
python facerecognition-video.py
```
